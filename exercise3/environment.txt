Browser: Google Chrome 130.0.6723.91 (64-bit)
Browser: Vivaldi 7.6 (64-bit)
Operating System: Windows 11 Pro, Version 23H2
Computer Architecture: x86-64 (Intel Core i7)

Testing Process
-------------------
1. Opened index.html locally in Google Chrome and Vivaldi to check for cross-browser layout consistency.
2. Resized window between 900px–1600px to verify responsive behavior of flexbox layout and image scaling.
3. Validated HTML syntax via the W3C Markup Validation Service.
4. Verified CSS with W3C CSS Validator to ensure compliance.
5. Confirmed that all navigation links scroll correctly to their respective sections.
6. Ensured that images load locally and have descriptive alt text.

These tests confirm that the webpage is functional, accessible, and visually consistent across common browsers.
